# Partnership Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: Premier Inc. (GPO Partnership)

**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity: Reduce Payment Processing Costs for Premier Members

**To**: partnerships@premierinc.com / Innovation Team Contact

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I'm [Your Name], CEO of Advancia Pay Ledger. We've built a healthcare payment platform that's processing $247K monthly for 24 healthcare facilities with 42% month-over-month growth.

Premier's 4,400+ hospital network could benefit significantly from our platform, which solves two critical problems:
• 2-3% reduction in payment processing costs (saving facilities $10K-20K monthly on $500K volume)
• Same-day settlement vs 2-5 days with traditional processors

I believe there's a strong strategic fit between Premier and Advancia:

FOR PREMIER MEMBERS:
- Exclusive cost savings through modern payment infrastructure
- Faster cash flow with same-day crypto settlements
- Dual payment options (traditional + cryptocurrency)

FOR PREMIER:
- 8% revenue share on all processing volume from referred members
- $1,000 referral fee per facility onboarded
- Position as payment innovation leader in healthcare

We're offering exclusive partnership terms to our first GPO partner. Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week to explore how we might work together?

I've attached a one-pager with more details on our traction and partnership model.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
CEO, Advancia Pay Ledger
[Email] | [Phone]

P.S. - Our current customers report 35% faster cash flow and 1.8% average savings on processing costs. Happy to share case studies.
