### Example Calculation: Mid-Size GPO

**Network Profile:**

Advancia Processing Fees (1.7%): $15M × 1.7% = $255,000
Partner Revenue Share (8%): $255,000 × 8% = $20,400/month

Annual Recurring Revenue: $20,400 × 12 = $244,800
```

```
Referral Fees: $50,000
Recurring Revenue: $244,800
TOTAL YEAR 1: $294,800
```

**Year 2-3 Projections (50% adoption):**
```
100 facilities × $300,000 × 1.7% × 8% = $40,800/month
Annual Revenue: $489,600
+ Referral Fees (50 new facilities): $50,000
TOTAL YEAR 2: $539,600
```

**3-Year Partnership Value:**
