## Strategic Partnership Proposal

## THE OPPORTUNITY

Healthcare payment processing is a **$100B+ market** dominated by legacy providers charging **2-4% fees** with **2-5 day settlements**. Healthcare facilities lose billions annually to processing costs and cash flow delays.

- 2-5 day settlement delays create cash flow challenges
- Legacy systems lack modern features (instant settlements, crypto options, API integrations)
- No innovation in healthcare payments for 20+ years
