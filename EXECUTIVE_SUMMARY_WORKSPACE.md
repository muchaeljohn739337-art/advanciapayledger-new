## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Do This

✅ Upload actual project files (not descriptions)
✅ Keep custom instructions specific and current
✅ Use one project per domain (technical/business/legal)
✅ Test agents before relying on them
✅ Update metrics monthly

### Don't Do This

❌ Mix contexts (business questions in technical project)
❌ Upload outdated documentation
❌ Ignore agent suggestions without review
❌ Expect perfection on first try
❌ Forget to update custom instructions

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY COMMANDS

```
ADVANCIA CORE:
"Show production logs for last hour and identify critical errors"
"Rollback to last stable deployment"
```

### Investor Question (urgent)

```
ADVANCIA BUSINESS:
"Generate response to: [investor question]"
"Create follow-up strategy"
```

### Security Incident

```
ADVANCIA COMPLIANCE:
"Initiate incident response plan"
"Audit access logs for suspicious activity"
```

### Deployment Blocker

```
ADVANCIA CORE:
"Identify and resolve deployment blockers for production"
"Execute emergency hotfix deployment"
```

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Tip 1: Chain Commands**
Instead of: "Do X" → wait → "Now do Y" → wait → "Now do Z"
Do this: "Do X, then Y, then Z and report results"

**Tip 2: Use Context**
Each project remembers all conversations. Reference previous work:
"Based on the optimization we discussed yesterday, implement the changes"

**Tip 3: Multi-Tab Workflow**
Keep 3 browser tabs open, one per project. Switch instantly between contexts.

**Tip 4: Template Everything**
Create templates for recurring tasks:

- API endpoint template
- Investor update template
- Partnership proposal template
- Compliance checklist template

**Tip 5: Trust But Verify**
Agents are powerful but not infallible:

- Review critical code changes
- Verify compliance recommendations
- Test before production deployment
